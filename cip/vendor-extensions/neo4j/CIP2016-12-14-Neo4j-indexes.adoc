== Background

In Neo4j, indexes are formed using label and property combinations.
This enables queries that reference these label/property combinations to use the index for faster lookup with reduced cardinality overhead.

== Proposal

Indexes in Neo4j are able to index _labeled nodes_ only.
These nodes are kept in a separate, persisted data structure which allows lookups based on providing values for the specified indexed properties.

=== Syntax

The index syntax is based on the constraint syntax, and is detailed below:

.Grammar definition for Neo4j index syntax.
[source, ebnf]
----
index command = create-index | drop-index ;
create-index  = "CREATE", "INDEX", [ index-name ], "FOR", index-pattern, "ON", index-key ;
index-pattern = node-pattern
index-name    = symbolic-name
index-key     = property-expression { ",", property-expression } ;
drop-index    = "DROP", "INDEX", index-name ;
----

The `index-key` expression defines the key for the index, and consist of one or more property expressions, which refer to the entity defined in the pattern.

==== Index names

Just like constraints, indexes have names.
Neo4j does not support user-defined names, but the index will be assigned a system-generated name.

==== Removing indexes

An index is removed by referring to its name.

.Example of dropping an index with name `index-1`:
[source, cypher]
----
DROP INDEX index-1
----

=== Semantics

Indexes do not impose any semantics on the graph, or on queries.
They exist solely for performance reasons.

Any query that is matching for nodes using a label and property/ies that match an index is viable to be planned using the matching index.
The _query key_ is formed by combining the referenced properties, and using this to scan the index for matching entities.
Predicates in which

==== Domain

Only nodes with the specified label, and values for _all_ the properties are considered part of the index domain.
This means that only queries that specify _all_ the properties will be able to be planned with index lookups.
Queries that only reference a subset of properties of an index will need the creation of another, smaller index that is defined using those properties only.

==== Mutability

Once an index has been created, its definition may not be amended.
Should a user wish to change its definition, the index will have to be dropped and recreated with an updated structure.

=== Examples

Creating indexes is straight-forward following the specified syntax.

.An index with multiple properties
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX
FOR (a:Address)
ON a.street, a.city, a.country
----

.An index with a single properties
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX
FOR (p:Person)
ON p.name
----

==== Combination with Neo4j constraints

In Neo4j, constraints are upheld through the use of indexes.
Neo4j supports three types of constraints: property uniqueness, property existence, and primary key.
These are expressed as exemplified below.

.A Neo4j property uniqueness constraint
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT
FOR (a:Address)
REQUIRE UNIQUE a.street
----

.A Neo4j node property existence constraint
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT
FOR (a:Address)
REQUIRE exists(a.street)
----

.A Neo4j relationship property existence constraint
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT
FOR ()-[o:OWNS]->()
REQUIRE exists(o.since)
----

.A Neo4j primary key constraint
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT
FOR (a:Address)
REQUIRE PRIMARY KEY a.street, a.city, a.country
----

Creating a constraint as outlined above will also create a matching index.
It will not be possible to drop that index without also dropping the constraint.
