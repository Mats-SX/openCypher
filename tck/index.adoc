= TCK Index

The TCK is split into categories based on language constructs.
The two main groups are clauses and expressions.
Each group enumerates its members.
Within each member, there is additional categories.

There is also `wip` directory containing uncategorised features.

== Clauses

Each clause has its own directory of Gherkin `.feature` files, or _feature_ for short.
Each feature follows a naming convention of `<clause-name><group-id>.feature`.


=== CREATE

* `Create1`: Creating nodes
** This group is about the creation of nodes.
* `Create2`: Creating relationships
** This group is about the creation of relationships.
* `Create3`: Interoperation with other clauses
** This group is about how the `CREATE` clause behaves when combined with other clauses.
* `Create4`: Large Create Query
** This group is about queries with a larger number of `CREATE` statements (more than 50)
* `Create5`: Multiple hops create patterns
** This group is about queries with a create pattern that feature more than one relationship.
* `Create6`: Negative tests
** This group is about failure cases for the `CREATE` clause; invalid queries.

Each category consists of a number of features.
